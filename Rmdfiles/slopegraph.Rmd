I try to at least scan the [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) feed everyday. Not every article is of interest to me, but I often have one of two different reactions to at least one article. Sometimes it is an *"ah ha"* moment because the article is right on point for a problem I have now or have had in the past and the article provides a (better) solution. Other times my reaction is more of an *"oh yeah"*, because it is something I have been meaning to investigate, or something I once knew, but the article brings a different perspective to it.

The second case happened to me this week. I've been aware of slopegraphs and bumpcharts for quite some time, and I certainly am aware of [Tufte's work](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/). As an amateur military historian I've always loved, for example, [his poster](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters) depicting Napoleon's Russian Campaign. So when I saw the article from [Murtaza Haider](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/murtaza-haider/) titled *"Edward Tufte’s Slopegraphs and political fortunes in Ontario"* I just had to take a peek and revisit the topic. 

The article does a good job of looking at slopegraphs in both `R` (via `plotrix`) and `Stata`, even providing the code to do the work. My challenge was that even though I'm adequate at plotting in base R, I much prefer using `ggplot2` wherever and whenever possible. My memory was that I had seen another article on the related topic of a `bumpchart` on R-bloggers in the not too distant past. A little sleuthing turned up [this earlier article](https://dominikkoch.github.io/Bump-Chart/) from [Dominik Koch](https://dominikkoch.github.io/aboutme/) who wrote some code to compare national performance at the Winter Olympics, *"Bump Chart - Track performance over time"*.

Finally, I wound up at [this Github repository](https://github.com/leeper/slopegraph) for a project called *"Edward Tufte-Inspired Slopegraphs"* from [Thomas J. Leeper](https://github.com/leeper) who has been building code to make slopegraphs using both base plotting functions and `ggplot2`.

My post today will draw a little bit from all their work and hopefully provide some useful samples for others to draw on if they share some of my quirks about data layout and a preference for `ggplot2` versus base `plot`.  I'm going to focus almost exclusively on slopegraphs, although much of the work could be extended to bumpcharts as well.

## Setup and library loading

We're going to make occasional use of `dplyr` to manipulate the data, extensive use of `ggplot2` to do the plotting and `ggrepel` to solve one specific labeling problem. We'll load them and I am suppressing the message from `dplyr` about namespace overrides.

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)
require(ggrepel)
require(kableExtra)

```

## Politics in Ontario

[The original post](https://ekonometrics.blogspot.com/2018/05/edward-tuftes-slopegraphs-and-political.html) is about plotting the data from some polling results in Ontario. For the reader's convenience I've made the data available via a `structure` command. We have data about two different polling dates, for 5 political parties, and the measured variable is percent of people supporting expressed as x.x (i.e. already multiplied by 100).

```{r slopegraph1}
data <- structure(list( Date = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), 
                                        .Label = c("11-May-18", "18-May-18"), 
                                        class = "factor"), 
                        Party = structure(c(5L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 5L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 4L), 
                                         .Label = c("Green", "Liberal", "NDP", "Others", "PC"), 
                                         class = "factor"), 
                        Pct = c(42.3, 28.4, 22.1, 5.4, 1.8, 41.9, 29.3, 22.3, 5, 1.4)), 
                  class = "data.frame", 
                  row.names = c(NA, -10L))

str(data)
head(data)
```

Let's just take the data as we have it and feed it to `ggplot` in a nice simple fashion and see what we get with very little effort.

```{r slopegraph1a}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Date, y = Pct, group = Party)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 4) +
  #  Labelling as desired
  labs(
    title = "Voter's stated preferences for June 7 elections in Ontario",
    subtitle = "(Mainstreet Research)",
    caption = "https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/gap-between-ndp-and-pcs-narrows-while-liberals-hold-steady/"
  )
```

The nice thing about `ggplot` is once you get used to the syntax it becomes very "readable". We've identified our dataset, the x & y variables and our grouping variable.  Lines too big? An adjustment to `size = 2` does it.  Don't like colors? Pull the `color = Party` clause.

So we're already pretty close to what we need.  Things are scaled properly and the basic labeling of titles etc. is accomplished.  Our biggest "problem" is that `ggplot` has been a little too helpful and adding some things we'd like to remove to give it a more *"Tuftesque"* look.  So what we'll do in the next few steps is add lines of code -- but they are mainly designed to remove unwanted elements.  This is in contrast to a base plot where we have to write the code to add elements.

So lets:

* Move the x axis labels to the top with `scale_x_discrete(position = "top")` 
* Change to a nice clean black and white theme `theme_bw()`
* Not display any legend(s) `theme(legend.position = "none")`
* Remove the default border from our plot `theme(panel.border = element_blank())`

```{r slopegraph1b}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Date, y = Pct, group = Party)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 4) +
  # move the x axis labels up top
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  theme_bw() +
  # Format tweaks
  # Remove the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # Remove the panel border
  theme(panel.border     = element_blank()) +
  #  Labelling as desired
  labs(
    title = "Voter's stated preferences for June 7 elections in Ontario",
    subtitle = "(Mainstreet Research)",
    caption = "https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/gap-between-ndp-and-pcs-narrows-while-liberals-hold-steady/"
  )
```

Nice progress! Continuing to remove things that can be considered "clutter" we add some additional lines that all end in `element_blank()` and are invoked to remove default plot items such as the plot grid, the y axcis text, etc..

```{r slopegraph1c}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Date, y = Pct, group = Party)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 4) +
  # move the x axis labels up top
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  theme_bw() +
  # Format tweaks
  # Remove the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # Remove the panel border
  theme(panel.border     = element_blank()) +
  # Remove just about everything from the y axis
  theme(axis.title.y     = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.y      = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
  # Remove a few things from the x axis and increase font size
  theme(axis.title.x     = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x.top      = element_text(size=12)) +
  # Remove x & y tick marks
  theme(axis.ticks       = element_blank()) +
  #  Labelling as desired
  labs(
    title = "Voter's stated preferences for June 7 elections in Ontario",
    subtitle = "(Mainstreet Research)",
    caption = "https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/gap-between-ndp-and-pcs-narrows-while-liberals-hold-steady/"
  )
```

Very nice! We're almost there! The "almost" is because now that we have removed both the legend and all scales and tick marks we no longer know who is who, and what the numbers are!  Plus, I'm a little unhappy with the way the titles are formatted, so we'll play with that. Later, I'll get fancy but for now let's just add some simple text labels on the left and right to show the party name and their percentage. The code `geom_text(aes(label = Party))` will place the party name right on top of the points that anchor either end of the line. If we make that `geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Party, " - ", Pct, "%")))` then we'll get labels that have both the party and the percent all neatly formatted, but still right on top of the points that anchor the ends of the line. `hjust` controls horizontal justification so if we change it to `geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Party, " - ", Pct, "%")), hjust = 1.35)` both sets of labels will slide to the left which is exactly what we want for the May 11 labels but not the May 18 labels. If we feed `hjust` a negative number  they'll go the other way.  So what we'll do is filter the data using the `filter` function from `dplyr` and place the left hand labels differently than the right hand labels. While we're at it we'll make it bold face font and a little larger...

```{r slopegraph1d}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Date, y = Pct, group = Party)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 4) +
  geom_text(data = data %>% filter(Date == "11-May-18"), 
            aes(label = paste0(Party, " - ", Pct, "%")) , 
            hjust = 1.35, 
            fontface = "bold", 
            size = 4) +
  geom_text(data = data %>% filter(Date == "18-May-18"), 
            aes(label = paste0(Party, " - ", Pct, "%")) , 
            hjust = -.35, 
            fontface = "bold", 
            size = 4) +
  # move the x axis labels up top
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  theme_bw() +
  # Format tweaks
  # Remove the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # Remove the panel border
  theme(panel.border     = element_blank()) +
  # Remove just about everything from the y axis
  theme(axis.title.y     = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.y      = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
  # Remove a few things from the x axis and increase font size
  theme(axis.title.x     = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x.top      = element_text(size=12)) +
  # Remove x & y tick marks
  theme(axis.ticks       = element_blank()) +
  # Format title & subtitle
  theme(plot.title       = element_text(size=14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle    = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  #  Labelling as desired
  labs(
    title = "Voter's stated preferences for June 7 elections in Ontario",
    subtitle = "(Mainstreet Research)",
    caption = "https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/gap-between-ndp-and-pcs-narrows-while-liberals-hold-steady/"
  )
```

Eureka! Not perfect yet but definitely looking good.

## Adding complexity

I'm feeling pretty good about the solution so far but there are three things I'd like to make better.

1.  How well will this solution work when we have more than two time periods? Need to make sure it generalizes to a more complex case.
2.  As [Murtaza Haider](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/murtaza-haider/) notes in his post we'll have issues if the data points are identical or very close together.  Our very neat little labels will overlap each other. In his post I believe he mentions that he manually moved them in some cases. Let's try and fix that.
3.  Oh my, that's a lot of code to keep cutting and pasting, can we simplify?

To test #1 and #2 I have "invented"" a new dataset called `moredata`.  **It is fictional** it's labelled May 25th but today is actually May 24th.  But I created it to add a third polling date and to make sure that we had a chance to test what happens when we have two identical datapoints on the same day.  Notice that on May 25th the polling numbers for the Liberals and the NDP are identical at 26.8%. 


```{r slopegraph2, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
moredata <- structure(list(Date = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L), 
                                            .Label = c("11-May-18", "18-May-18", "25-May-18"), 
                                            class = "factor"), 
                           Party = structure(c(5L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 5L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 4L, 5L, 3L, 2L, 1L, 4L), 
                                             .Label = c("Green", "Liberal", "NDP", "Others", "PC"), 
                                             class = "factor"), 
                           Pct = c(42.3, 28.4, 22.1, 5.4, 1.8, 41.9, 29.3, 22.3, 5, 1.4, 41.9, 26.8, 26.8, 5, 1.4)), 
                      class = "data.frame", 
                      row.names = c(NA, -15L))
tail(moredata)
```

You'll notice at the beginning of this post I loaded the `ggrepel` library.  `ggrepel` works with `ggplot2` to *repel* things that overlap, in this case our `geom_text` labels.  The invocation is `geom_text_repel` and it is very similar to `geom_text` but allows us to deconflict the overlaps.  We'll use `hjust = "left"` and `hjust = "right"` to control justifying the labels.  We'll use a fixed nudge left and right `nudge_x = -.45` and `nudge_x = .5` to move the labels left and right off the plotted data points and we will explicitly tell `geom_text_repel` to only move the labels vertically to avoid overlap with `direction = "y"`.  Everything else remains the same.

```{r slopegraph2a, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
ggplot(data = moredata, aes(x = Date, y = Pct, group = Party)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 4) +
  geom_text_repel(data = moredata %>% filter(Date == "11-May-18"), 
                  aes(label = paste0(Party, " - ", Pct, "%")) , 
                  hjust = "left", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 4, 
                  nudge_x = -.45, 
                  direction = "y") +
  geom_text_repel(data = moredata %>% filter(Date == "25-May-18"), 
                  aes(label = paste0(Party, " - ", Pct, "%")) , 
                  hjust = "right", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 4, 
                  nudge_x = .5, 
                  direction = "y") +
  # move the x axis labels up top
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  theme_bw() +
  # Format tweaks
  # Remove the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # Remove the panel border
  theme(panel.border     = element_blank()) +
  # Remove just about everything from the y axis
  theme(axis.title.y     = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.y      = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
  # Remove a few things from the x axis and increase font size
  theme(axis.title.x     = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x.top      = element_text(size=12)) +
  # Remove x & y tick marks
  theme(axis.ticks       = element_blank()) +
  # Format title & subtitle
  theme(plot.title       = element_text(size=14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle    = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  #  Labelling as desired
  labs(
    title = "Bogus Data",
    subtitle = "(Chuck Powell)",
    caption = "https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/gap-between-ndp-and-pcs-narrows-while-liberals-hold-steady/"
  )
```

Very nice! We have confirmed that our solution works for more than two dates without any additional changes and we have found a solution to the label overlap issue. In a little while we'll talk about labeling the data points in the center (if we want to). 

Before we move on let's make our life a little simpler.  While the output plot is good it's a lot of code to produce one graph. Let's see if we can simplify...

Since ggplot2 objects are just regular R objects, you can put them in a list. This means you can apply all of R’s great functional programming tools. For example, if you wanted to add different geoms to the same base plot, you could put them in a list and use lapply().

But for now let's at least take all the invariant lines of code and put them in a list.  Then when we go to plot we can just invoke the list and remain confident we get the right formatting. For now let's name this list something quaint and obvious like `MySpecial`.

```{r slopegraph3, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
MySpecial <- list(  
  # move the x axis labels up top
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top"),
  theme_bw(),
  # Format tweaks
  # Remove the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none"),
  # Remove the panel border
  theme(panel.border     = element_blank()),
  # Remove just about everything from the y axis
  theme(axis.title.y     = element_blank()),
  theme(axis.text.y      = element_blank()),
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()),
  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()),
  # Remove a few things from the x axis and increase font size
  theme(axis.title.x     = element_blank()),
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()),
  theme(axis.text.x.top      = element_text(size=12)),
  # Remove x & y tick marks
  theme(axis.ticks       = element_blank()),
  # Format title & subtitle
  theme(plot.title       = element_text(size=14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)),
  theme(plot.subtitle    = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
)
summary(MySpecial)
```

`MySpecial` is actually an incredibly complex structure so I used the `summary` function. What's important to us is that in the future all we need to do is include it in the `ggplot` command and magic happens. Perhaps another day I'll make it a proper function but for now I can change little things like line size or titles and labels without worrying about the rest.  So here it is with some little things changed.

```{r slopegraph3a, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
ggplot(data = moredata, aes(x = Date, y = Pct, group = Party)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Party, alpha = 1), size = 3) +
  geom_text_repel(data = moredata %>% filter(Date == "11-May-18"), 
                  aes(label = paste0(Party, " : ", Pct, "%")) , 
                  hjust = "left", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 4, 
                  nudge_x = -.45, 
                  direction = "y") +
  geom_text_repel(data = moredata %>% filter(Date == "25-May-18"), 
                  aes(label = paste0(Party, " : ", Pct, "%")) , 
                  hjust = "right", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 4, 
                  nudge_x = .5, 
                  direction = "y") +
  MySpecial +
  labs(
    title = "Bogus Data",
    subtitle = "(Chuck Powell)",
    caption = "https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/gap-between-ndp-and-pcs-narrows-while-liberals-hold-steady/"
  )
```

## Even more complex

Feeling good about the solution so far I decided to press on to a much more complex problem. [Thomas J. Leeper](https://github.com/leeper) has a nice plot of [Tufte's Cancer survival slopegraph](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk) **N.B. that the original Tufte is not accurate on the vertical scale. Look at Prostate and Thyroid for example since visually I would argue they should cross to reflect the data**.

Let's grab the data as laid out by Tufte.

```{r slopegraph4, fig.height=11, fig.width=9}
cancer <- structure(list(Year.5 = c(99, 96, 95, 89, 86, 85, 84, 82, 71, 69, 63, 62, 62, 58, 57, 55, 43, 32, 30, 24, 15, 14, 8, 4), 
                         Year.10 = c(95, 96, 94, 87, 78, 80, 83, 76, 64, 57, 55, 54, 55, 46, 46, 49, 32, 29, 13, 19, 11, 8, 6, 3), 
                         Year.15 = c(87, 94, 91, 84, 71, 74,  81, 70, 63, 46, 52, 50, 54, 38, 38, 50, 30, 28, 7, 19, 7, 8, 6, 3), 
                         Year.20 = c(81, 95, 88, 83, 75, 67, 79, 68, 60, 38, 49, 47, 52, 34, 33, 50, 26, 26, 5, 15, 6, 5, 8, 3)), 
                    class = "data.frame", 
                    row.names = c("Prostate", "Thyroid", "Testis", "Melanomas", "Breast", "Hodgkin's", "Uterus", "Urinary", "Cervix", "Larynx", "Rectum", "Kidney", "Colon", "Non-Hodgkin's", "Oral", "Ovary", "Leukemia", "Brain", "Multiple myeloma", "Stomach", "Lung", "Esophagus", "Liver", "Pancreas"))

str(cancer)
kable(head(cancer,10)) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

There, we have it in a neat data frame but not organized as we need it.  Not unusual, and an opportunity to use some other tools from `broom` and `reshape2`.  Let's do the following:

1.  Let's transpose the data with `t`
2.  Let's use `broom::fix_data_frame` to get valid column names and convert rownames to a proper column all in one function.  Right now the types of cancer are nothing but rownames.
3.  Use `reshape2::melt` to take our transposed dataframe and convert it to long format so we can send it off to `ggplot`. Along the way we'll rename the resulting dataframe `newcancer` with columns named `Year`, `Type` and `Survival`.


```{r slopegraph4a, fig.height=11, fig.width=9}
# stepping through for demonstration purposes
t(cancer) # returns a matrix

broom::fix_data_frame(
   t(cancer), 
   newcol = "Year") # make it a dataframe with Year as a proper column

reshape2::melt(
   broom::fix_data_frame(
      t(cancer), 
      newcol = "Year"), 
   id="Year", variable.name="Type", value.name = "Survival") # melt it to long form
# all those steps in one long line saved to a new dataframe
newcancer <- reshape2::melt(broom::fix_data_frame(t(cancer), newcol = "Year"), id="Year", variable.name="Type", value.name = "Survival")
```

Now we have whipped the data into the shape we need it.  96 rows with the three columns we want to plot, `Year`, `Type`, and `Survival`.  If you look at the data though, you'll notice two small faults.  First, `Year` is not a `factor`.  The plot will work but have an annoying limitation. Since "Year.5" is a character string it will be ordered after all the other years.  We could fix that on the fly within our `ggplot` call but I find it cleaner and more understandable if I take care of that first. I'll use the `factor` function from base `R` to accomplish that and while I'm at it make the values nicer looking. Second in three cases `R` changed cancer type names because they couldn't be column names in a dataframe.  I'll use `forcats::fct_recode` to make them look better.

```{r slopegraph4b, fig.height=11, fig.width=8}
newcancer$Year <- factor(newcancer$Year, 
                         levels = c("Year.5", "Year.10", "Year.15", "Year.20"), 
                         labels = c("5 Year","10 Year","15 Year","20 Year"), 
                         ordered = TRUE)
newcancer$Type <- forcats::fct_recode(newcancer$Type, 
                                      "Hodgkin's" = "Hodgkin.s", 
                                      "Non-Hodgkin's" = "Non.Hodgkin.s", 
                                      "Multiple myeloma" = "Multiple.myeloma")
head(newcancer)
```

Now that we have the data the way we want it we can make our slopegraph.  Some of the necessary changes are obvious `x = Year`, `y = Survival` and `group = Type` for example.  Since there are a lot of plotted lines I've reduced the weight or size of the individual lines. We no longer want to plot the big round points, we're going to substitute in the actual numbers, so that line gets commented out.  The left and right labels require no change and `geom_text_repel` will keep them from overlapping which is almost inevitable given the data. To put the actual survival numbers on the plot we'll turn to `geom_label`. It's like `geom_text` only it puts a label box around the text.  We'll choose a smallish size, minimize the amount of padding, and make the border of the box invisible.  The end result is what we want.  It overlays on top of the lines we've already plotted and the invisible padding gives us just enough room.

```{r slopegraph4c, fig.height=11, fig.width=9.5}
ggplot(data = newcancer, aes(x = Year, y = Survival, group = Type)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Type, alpha = 1), size = 1) +
#  geom_point(aes(color = Type, alpha = .1), size = 4) +
  geom_text_repel(data = newcancer %>% filter(Year == "5 Year"), 
                  aes(label = Type) , 
                  hjust = "left", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 3, 
                  nudge_x = -.45, 
                  direction = "y") +
  geom_text_repel(data = newcancer %>% filter(Year == "20 Year"), 
                  aes(label = Type) , 
                  hjust = "right", 
                  fontface = "bold", 
                  size = 3, 
                  nudge_x = .5, 
                  direction = "y") +
  geom_label(aes(label = Survival), 
             size = 2.5, 
             label.padding = unit(0.05, "lines"), 
             label.size = 0.0) +
  MySpecial +
  labs(
    title = "Estimates of Percent Survival Rates",
    subtitle = "Based on: Edward Tufte, Beautiful Evidence, 174, 176.",
    caption = "https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk"
